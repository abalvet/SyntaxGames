# An experimental SNAKE game to learn structural syntax

This is an experimental adaptation of the classical SNAKE game: eat all grammatical words!!! 
Don't hit the walls, and don't eat your own tail!

Localized versions (in French, Spanish, and Latin because why not?), and other missions  will be released soon.
